# PlanIt

index.html is the main page, where it features a button to add a new task, incomplete and complete labels signifying the status of each task, and sample tasks. 

## Styling: 
The checkboxes are not finished with styling and the tasks do not have a remove or edit button yet.

## Buttons:
Add Task: Once clicked, the button changes to an input text field where the user can type in their new task. Once the user has typed their task, they will press enter to add their task to the incomplete category.
